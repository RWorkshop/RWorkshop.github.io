Introduction to R
===========================

### What is R?

<h5> What is R? </h5>

R is an open-source statistical package based on the S language. 
It is a powerful computing tool that combines the usefulness of a statistical analysis package with that of a publication quality graphics package and a matrix-based programming language. 
It's easy enough to use for quick and simple tasks, yet powerful enough for the most demanding ones. 
The goal of this demonstration is to provide a basic introduction to using R. 
An R session differs from that of other statistical software. You will find it to be an interactive approach where the results from one step lead to the next. 
This introduction to R is necessarily limited in scope to only a handful of analyses. 
Once you become familiar with R and browse through some of the online help topics, you will discover tools for practically any type of analysis you need. S-PLUS is a commercial application also based on the S language. Much of R is identical to the command line useage of S-PLUS. There are differences though in some functions and their arguments so existing S-PLUS code may require some modification to run in R.
