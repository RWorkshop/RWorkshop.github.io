Forthcoming Workshops

Introduction to Probability with R   (30th May 19:00 -21:00  Module B)
A Taste of R (With Coding Grace)   (8th June 10:00-14:00  Module A)
About Dublin R’s Worskhops

Each workshop has a particular theme, with a suitable lesson plan for each.

Module A :  Introduction to R

This Module is an introduction to the R environment, using the R console, accessing help facilities, and using packages. Important data structures (or objects) are also looked at.

Download some of the sample notes here ( expect some revisions)

Module A Part 1
Module A Part 2
Module A Part 3 (Matrices)
Data Sets :  Crime  GE  GNW  Kasser Cheeses

Module B : Probability with R

In this workshop, we will look at probability, probability distributions, running simple simulation studies and tackling some well-known problems such as the Monty Hall Problem.

The workshop would cover some basic graphics, i.e. plotting a line plot.

Module C1 : Graphics with R

In this module, we will look at how to construct graphics and simple data visualizations with R.

Module C2 : The ggplot2 package

In this module, we will look at the excellent ggplot2 package – used to make high standard data visualizations.

Module D : Statistics with R

In this module, we shall cover commonly used statistical procedures, implementable through R.
