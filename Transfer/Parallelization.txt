To speed up for Loops. One may consider parallelization.

For this, we would use the for each or package

Syntax is very similar to The Standard for Loop syntax.

The first step is to specify the number of cores that you intend to use.

Typically. Our will only use one of the cores available to it.


### Optimal Numbers of Cores

You may use as many of the cores available to you as possible. What you must leave

Some cores.

Dedicated to the overall maintenance of the offering system, if you use all of the cores, you're going to cause problems for yourself.

Another important factor to consider is that not all jobs are parallelizable.

It is best. To reserve this approach for relatively simple. Procedures that just require quite a lot of iterations.

Algorithm.


### Collecting the Results

The last step is to specify how the results of the individual processes are to be collated.
