\section{Saving and Loading R Data Objects}
In situations where a good deal of processing must be used on a raw dataset in order to prepare it for analysis, it may be prudent to save the \texttt{R} objects you create in their internal binary form. 

One attractive feature of this scheme is that the objects created can be read by \texttt{R} programs running on different computer architectures than the one on which they were created, making it very easy to move your data between different computers. 

Each time an \texttt{R} session is completed, you are prompted to save the workspace image, which is a binary file called \texttt{.RData} in the working directory. 

Whenever \texttt{R} encounters such a file in the working directory at the beginning of a session, it automatically loads it making all your saved objects available again. 
So one method for saving your work is to always save your workspace image at the end of an R session. If you’d like to save your workspace image at some other time during your R session, you can use the \texttt{save.image()} function, which, when called with no arguments, will also save the current workspace to a file called .RData in the working directory.
\section{Quitting the R environment}
As the front page text indicates – all you have to do to quite the workspace is to type in \texttt{q()}. You will then be prompted to save your work.
