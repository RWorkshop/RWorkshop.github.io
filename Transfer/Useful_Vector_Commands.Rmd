{Sequences}
{Using the colon operator}
A `count-up' or a `count-down' will be determined automatically.
<pre>
<code>
1:20
20:1
10:20
</code>
</pre>

### 
{Using the \texttt{seq()} operator}
Firstly we will mimic the sequences that we have created using the colon operator.
<pre>
<code>
seq(1,20)
seq(20,1)
</code>
</pre>


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------%
### 
{Examples using operators}

We can use relational and logical operators to selecting elements
of a vector with specified criteria.

<pre>
<code>
x <- 1:12

#selecting all elements of x greater than 5
x[x>5]

#selecting all elements of x greater or equal to than 5
x[x>=5]

#selecting all elements of x greater than 5 #or less than 3
x[(x>5)|(x<3)]

#selecting all elements of x between 3 and 5
x[(x>3)&(x<5)]
</code>
</pre>

### 
{Data Selection and manipulation}


*  \texttt{sort(x)} : sorts the object $x$ in ascending order.
*  \texttt{rev(x)} : reverses the order of $x$ without sorting it
