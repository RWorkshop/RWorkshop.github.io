#### Using Flexdashboard

Flex dashboard is essentially a framework that uses our markdown files. I'm provides various choices for layouts.


* Layouts: I had my own sort of personal favorite form of layout and I usually stick with that, but other ones are possible.

* Organization accounts on github
* deployment on github.io is straigthforward

---------------------------------

* CSS Layouts for FlexDashboards
* Build a consistent brand identity

---------------------------------

#### Shiny Integrations with Flexdashboard

It is actually possible to integrate shiny Widgets, and HTML interfaces into a Flexdashboard. 
If that level of complexity is required - just build a shiny app

--------------------------------

#### HTML and RMarkdown Modules 

* Preformatted Text as a function
* Equivalents of Standard HTML tags
* There is one exception to this rule is that you can using WithHTML.
