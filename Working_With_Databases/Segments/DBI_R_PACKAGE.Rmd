DBI
The DBI package helps connecting R to database management systems (DBMS). DBI separates the connectivity to the DBMS into a “front-end” and a “back-end”. The package defines an interface that is implemented by DBI backends such as:

RPostgres,
RMariaDB,
RSQLite,
odbc,
bigrquery,
and many more, see the list of backends. R scripts and packages use DBI to access various databases through their DBI backends.

The interface defines a small set of classes and methods similar in spirit to Perl’s DBI, Java’s JDBC, Python’s DB-API, and Microsoft’s ODBC. It supports the following operations:

connect/disconnect to the DBMS
create and execute statements in the DBMS
extract results/output from statements
error/exception handling
information (meta-data) from database objects
transaction management (optional)
Installation
Most users who want to access a database do not need to install DBI directly. It will be installed automatically when you install one of the database backends:

RPostgres for PostgreSQL,
RMariaDB for MariaDB or MySQL,
RSQLite for SQLite,
odbc for databases that you can access via ODBC,
bigrquery,
… .
You can install the released version of DBI from CRAN with:

install.packages("DBI")
