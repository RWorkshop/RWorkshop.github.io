#### About the Northwind sample database
The Northwind database is a sample database that was originally created by Microsoft and used as the basis for their tutorials in a variety of database products for decades. The Northwind database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world. The Northwind database is an excellent tutorial schema for a small-business ERP, with customers, orders, inventory, purchasing, suppliers, shipping, employees, and single-entry accounting. The Northwind database has since been ported to a variety of non-Microsoft databases, including PostgreSQL.

The Northwind dataset includes sample data for the following.

* Suppliers: Suppliers and vendors of Northwind
* Customers: Customers who buy products from Northwind
* Employees: Employee details of Northwind traders
* Products: Product information
* Shippers: The details of the shippers who ship the products from the traders to the end-customers
* Orders and Order_Details: Sales Order transactions taking place between the customers & the company



The Northwind sample database includes 14 tables and the table relationships are showcased in the following entity relationship diagram.
