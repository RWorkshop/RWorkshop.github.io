## Using {dblyr} 

#### Complex Query 

* This R package converts Tidyverse statements into their equivalent forms in SQL.

* For the sake of simplicity, it is better to use a relatively straightforward statement when creating a query, i.e. just using <tt>group_by</tt>, <tt>filter()</tt>, <tt>select()</tt> and <tt>summarize()</tt> commands.

* Any subsequent transformations can be carried out when the data is transferred to the R environment.


-----------------------

#### Compatible Object Classes


* It is important to note that SQL databases support a greater variety of object types, compared to R, and may not be able to support some object types. 
* This will impede the ability of R to download certain object classes.
* Other approaches may be required approaches such as postgresql.

* If an analysis specifically requires these more complex object classes, then probably {dbplyr} and {tidyverse} are not the correct toolkit. In this case, one should consider other approaches.
