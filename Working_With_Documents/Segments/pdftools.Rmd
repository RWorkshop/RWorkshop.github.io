### pdftools: Introduction 

Part A. Working with PDFs



Downloading PDF documents from the internet.
(Same approach for ZIP Files)

PDF Info
Useful for information about how PDF was created
Was it a word document saved as a PDF in Microsoft Office
(relevant to OCR - this has higher fidelity compared to a Photocopy
Pdf documents

### Extracting Text

We can use the PDF tools are package to extract text from PDF documents or documents that are saved from PDF towards the process is very effective.

#### Optical Character Recognition

* OCR "reads" the text and created a text file.




```{r eval=FALSE}

library(pdftools)

pagetext <- pdftools::pdf_text(ThisFileName)
grep("Appendix 2: Map",pagetext)

```

### pdftools

Import a "IpsumLorum_1.pdf"

!! For Loop All The Things


Code , but not to

FOR Loops worked fine.
Everyone was already familar with them, and there was no need to give anyone additional guidance.
Efficiencies may be obtained by using other approaches, but the benefit did not exceed overhead about explaining other approaches.

-------------------------

If the pdf document is a direct conversion of a MS Word Document, there should be very high accuracy.
If the pdf document is a good quality photocopy scan, the accuracy levels should still be reasonably high.

If the pdf document is a poor quality photocopy scan - using pdftools may not work in the first instance, and additional steps would be required.
-------------------------

Visual Inspection would be a long and tedious process, but far less labour intensive than writing out documents.
Quality Control can be parallelized.

------------------------

The same errors tent to crop up again and again.
For example "l" (Small L) and "1" (the number one) get mistaken for each other.

Very uncomplicated, but effective approach

<pre><code>
my_Text <- gsub("This is Wrong","This is Right",my_Text)
my_Text <- gsub("That is Wrong","That is Right",my_Text)
......
</code></pre>
