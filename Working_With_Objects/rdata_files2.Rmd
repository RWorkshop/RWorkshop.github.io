Creating ".rdata" files.


#### Arguments 

There are two key arguments that must be specified. 
For this command to run effectively first, it was specified. The list of objects that you want to have stored in this ".rdata" file.

If you forget to include the "list=" argument, we'll just past the object name that you have provided as a string contained in an unnamed object. 
So, it's very important to include "list=" argument.

Likewise, it is important that you include "file=" when naming the object.
