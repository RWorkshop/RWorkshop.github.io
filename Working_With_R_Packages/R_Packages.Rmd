Packages
R contains one or more libraries of packages. Packages contain various functions and data sets for numerous purposes, e.g. the “ggplot2” graphics package, the “actuar” financial package, the “nlme” statistical methods package, etc. 

R consists of a base package and many additional packages. Some packages are part of the basic installation. 

Others must be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), on the R website.

(Remark: most, but not all packages, are on CRAN. Another repository is R Forge. There are now several thousand packages there.)

To access all of the functions and data sets in a particular package, it must first be loaded into the workspace. 

For example, to load the nlme package:

> library(nlme)
> #you can now use this package

You can remove a package you have loaded using the command detach().

One important thing to note is that if you terminate your session and start a new session with the saved workspace, you must load the packages again.
