#### Reading and Writing Data

Connections
Connections provide a flexible way for R to read data from a variety of sources, providing more complete control over the nature of the connection than simply specifying a file name as input to functions like read.table and scan.

pipe: output from a command
textConnection: treats text as a file
gzfile: local gzipped file
unz: local zip archive (with single file; read-only)
bzfile: local bzipped file
url: remote file read via http
socketConnection: socket for client/server programs
