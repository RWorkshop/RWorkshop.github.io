### Question 1

<h4>Exercise 1</h4>

An employee at a café has been trained to set the coffee machine so that an espresso
coffee portion results in 2.0 grams of coffee being placed into a cup. 

Knowing that
variations are expected, the employee pours eight portions and measures the amounts
to be 
$$\{1.95, 1.80, 2.10, 1.82, 1.75, 2.01, 1.83, 1.90\}$$.

#### Exercises

1. Calculate an 95% confidence interval for the mean size of espresso coffee
portions. 
2. Comment on whether the mean portion of coffee is equal to 2.0 grams. 
3. Repeat Exercises 1 and 2 for an 80% confidence interval

### Question 2
<h4>Exercise 2</h4>
A researcher has collected the following data on a group of students, regarding
whether they passed or failed an exam and whether or not they attended tutorials:


| Number of students  | Exam Passed | Exam Failed |  
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Attended tutorials  | 132 | 27 |  
| Did not attend tutorials  | 120 | 51 |  
|  |  |  |  |  |


#### Exercises
The researcher wants to establish whether tutorial attendance is independent of exam
success, using a chi-square test.

1. State the hypotheses of this test. 

2. Calculate the expected frequencies for the data under the null hypotheses
in part 1.

3. Perform the test stating clearly your conclusion. 


The data can be entered into R using the following code:
```{r}
exam.success = matrix(c(132,120,27,51),ncol=2,nrow=2) 
```

### Question 3



A machine in a sweet factory fills bags of sweets to weigh 500 grams. The actual
weight of the sweet bags is known to follow a Normal distribution. 

The sweet manufacturer believes that the machine is under-filling the sweet bags. A sample of
10 sweet bags is taken and weighed, as summarised below.

|  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Bag | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
|Weight (grams) | 474.11 | 512.01 | 493.64 | 495.03 | 518.13 | 486.03 | 494.48 | 501.76 | 498.83 | 503.02 |

---


#### Exercises


1. Perform a suitable t-test to determine whether the sweet bags are being
consistently under-filled, stating the hypotheses and the level of significance
used in the test. 

2. Propose an interpretation of your conclusion in part 1. 



The data can be entered into R using the following code:


```{r}
weight<-c(474.11,512.01,493.64,495.03,518.13,486.03,
494.48,501.76,498.83,503.02)
```

### Question 4

4 Data were collected on average alcohol and cigarette consumption per adult per year 
for a number of countries. The data are given in the file smoking_data.RData
and contain the following information:

* ***country*** the country concerned;
* ***alcohol***: alcohol consumption per adult per year (litres/year);
* ***cigarettes***: number of cigarettes consumed per adult per year.

#### Exercises
(i) (a) Construct a scatterplot of the data with alcohol consumption on the 
x axis.
(b) Comment on the relationship between the data on alcohol and cigarette 
consumption based on your plot in part (i)(a).

(ii) Calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the data on alcohol and 
cigarette consumption. 
An analyst suggests using the following R code to modify the data:
(iii) Explain what the above code does and give a justification for its use. 
For the remainder of the question, use the modified data 
(alcohol.2, cigarettes.2), as produced by applying the R code above.
(iv) (a) Construct a scatterplot with alcohol consumption on the x axis.
(b) Calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient between the new data on 
alcohol and cigarette consumption.
(c) Comment on your answers in parts (ii) and (iv)(b). 

(v) Perform a hypothesis test for the null hypothesis that Pearson’s population 
correlation coefficient is equal to zero, against the alternative that it is positive. 
You should report the p-value of the test and a clear conclusion. 

A media bulletin has reported that ‘'h‘igher alcohol consumption causes higher cigarette consumption .
(vi) Comment on whether this report is justified based on your analysis in parts (iv) 
and (v). 

```{r}
alcohol.2 = alcohol[-c(6,16)]
cigarettes.2 = cigarettes[-c(6,16)]
```

(vii) Perform a simple linear regression analysis on the new data using a 
model of the form y = α + βx + ε (cigarette consumption, y, on alcohol 
consumption, x), where the error terms ε independently follow a 
N(0, s2) distribution.
Your answer should show the fitted line plotted on the data scatterplot 
and report the estimate of parameter s. [5]
(viii) State the proportion of the total variability of the responses explained 
by the model, based on your output in part (vii). [1]
(ix) Plot a graph of the residuals of the model fitted in part (vii) 
against the explanatory variable. 
(x) Comment on the validity of the model, based on your output in 
part (ix) . 

### Question 5
5 A waiting time random variable X follows an Exponential distribution with rate l
parameterised as f(x) = le–lx
 (x > 0, l > 0).
The rate l has a Gamma prior distribution with parameters a and s. A Bayesian 
credibility model provides that the posterior mean of 1/l can be expressed as
Z 3x + (1– Z)3 s
α – 1, where Z = 
n
α + n – 1
with n being the number of past waiting times observed.
Assume that the parameters of the prior Gamma distribution are a = 5 and s = 1.
(i) Determine an estimate of the posterior mean of 1/l assuming n = 10 by 
implementing M = 3,000 Monte Carlo repetitions. [14]
(ii) Determine an estimate of the posterior mean of 1/l and the value of x when 
n = 1,000, by implementing M = 3,000 Monte Carlo repetitions. [15]
(iii) Plot the histograms of the samples of the posterior mean of 1/l and of x
obtained in part (ii). 
(iv) Compare, by visual inspection of the graphs in part (iii), the distributions
 of the posterior mean of 1/l and the distribution of x when n = 1,000. 
(v) Comment on the behaviour of the credibility model as n increases, relating 
your answer to your findings in part (iv).
