### Question 1
<h4> Question 1</h4>
Data is available for the movement of taxis in Dublin. 

The city is divided into three zones “North”, “South” and “West”. (*The “East” is Dublin Bay*)

The movement of a taxi from one zone to another will depend only on its current position. 

The following probabilities have been determined for taxi movements:


* Of all taxis in the North zone, 30% will remain in North and 30% will move to South, with the remaining 40% moving to West.

* In the South zone, taxis have a 40% chance of moving to North, 40% chance of staying in South and 20% chance of moving to West.

* Of all the drivers in the West zone, 50% will move to North and 30% to South with the remaining 20% staying in West.

The movement of taxis in Dublin will be modelled in R using a Markov Chain.



#### Driver Movement
A 3 - dimensional discrete Markov Chain defined by the following states:
North, South, West

The transition matrix (by rows) is defined as follows:

| North | South | West |
North | 0.3 | 0.3 | 0.4|
South | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2|
West | 0.5 | 0.3 | 0.2|

### Question 2 (Part (a))

<h4> Question 2 (Part (a)) </h4>
* An exponential distribution has a parameter of $\lambda = 0.4$.

* Use the in-built functions in R to perform the following tasks.



#### Exercise 1


Simulate 1,000 values from this distribution, assigning this to a variable called ``Exp_Vector`` and calculate the mean and variance of
the simulated values. Paste the results of your calculation into your answer.

(a) Simulate 1,000 values from this distribution, assigning this to a 
variable called Exp_Vector and calculate the mean and variance of 
the simulated values. Paste the results of your calculation into your 
answer.


#### Exercise 2
(b) Plot a histogram of Exp_Vector showing the frequencies and paste 
the plot into your answer.


#### Exercise 3
(c) Plot the probability density function for this distribution as:
 1 a scatter plot
 2 a line graph.
 Paste your plots into your answer
 
 
 
### Question 3

<h4>Question 3</h4>
You have been asked to analyse the percentage changes in quarterly personal 
consumption expenditure and personal disposable income in the US from 1970–2010. 
This information is contained in a time series called “consumption” in R’s fpp library.
The data can be loaded into R using the command: 
<pre><code>
install.packages(“fpp”)
library(fpp)

consumption <- usconsumption[,1]
</code></pre>

(i) Plot this time series giving appropriate labels for each axis and paste the R 
code and the chart into your answer. 

#### Exercise 2
(ii) (a) Plot the Autocorrelation function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation 
function (PACF), giving appropriate labels for each axis and paste the R code and the charts into your answer. [8]
(b) Comment on your plots in part (ii)(a), making reference to the 
stationarity. 

#### Exercise 3
Fit the most appropriate ARIMA model based on the results in part (ii)(a), 
stating the equation of the model and justifying your choice. 


### Question 3 (Part (b))

The dataset usconsumption also includes the quarterly personal disposable income from 1970 to 2010. The data can be loaded into R using the command:

<pre><code>
income <- usconsumption[,2]
</code></pre>

(iv) (a) Compare the performance of the ARIMA model you have chosen in 
part (iii) with a linear regression model of consumption on income, by computing the root mean square error (RMSE) for the fitted values ofeach model. Paste your coding and R output into your answer.

(b) Explain why the RMSE is not the ideal measure to compare these models, including a recommendation of a more appropriate measure.

An analyst has suggested that neither model in part (iv) is a good fit to the data and has asked you to propose an alternative model.

#### Exercise 5
* Suggest a suitable alternative model to fit to the data.
* Fit the model you have suggested to the data, stating the 
equation used.
* Compare the results of this model to the models fitted in exercise 4.
