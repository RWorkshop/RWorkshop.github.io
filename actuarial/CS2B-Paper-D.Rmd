### Question 3
<h4> Question 3 </h4>
Q. 3) Mortality of a group of lives follows Gompertz‚Äôs law. The value of the parameters is known 
as c = 1.128 & B = 7.29 x 10-6

, calculate an approximate of the curtate value 
for age 55 or e55. Assuming 100 is the maximum age. 

### Question 4
<h4> Question 4 </h4>
An life insurance company is selling Endowment, Pure Term and Unit Linked products wherein 80% of the business comes from Endowment, 5% from Term Insurance and 15% 
from Unit Linked products. The sum assured ranges between 30000 to 200000 with multiple 
of 5000. 

The sum assured are normally distributed with below parameters - Endowment
(mean 50000, standard deviation 10000), Pure Term (mean 100000, standard deviation 
25000), Unit Linked (mean 60000, standard deviation 5000). One policy is randomly picked 
from the system and the sum assured of that policy is 75000. 

#### Exercises

1.  Create a sequence ranging from 30000 to 200000 with an increase of 5000 and plot the 
density functions of the above three distributions in a single graph. 
2.   Find the probability that the policy (75000 sum assured) comes from the Endowment 
product portfolio and the probability that the policy comes from Unit Linked Product 
portfolio. 

### Question 5
<h4> Question 5 </h4>
Signals are mathematically represented by a function that takes into account the magnitude 
and frequency.
xt = A cos(2œÄ\omega t + \phi) + wt, where \omega  is equal to 1/50 and wt is the white noise with mean 
zero and SD of 5. A and \phi need to be estimated.
In this case the parameters appear in a nonlinear way, so we use a trigonometric identity 
and write

$$
A cos(2œÄ\omega t + \phi) = A cos(\phi) cos(2œÄ\omega t) - A sin(\phi) sin(2œÄ\omega t),
= Œ≤1 cos(2œÄ\omega t) + Œ≤2 sin(2œÄ\omega t),
= Œ≤1*z1 + Œ≤2*z2
$$

If we can estimate Œ≤1 and Œ≤2, then A and \phi can be estimated.
Therefore, $xt = Œ≤1 cos(2œÄ\omega t) + Œ≤2 sin(2œÄ\omega t) + wt $

#### Exercises
1.  Simulate and plot a series xt, using A=2, \phi = 0.6œÄ and SD of white noise as 5 (for t= 1 
to 1000). 
2.   Generate two series z1 and z2 (for t= 1 to 1000). 
3.    Fit a Linear model to between xt, z1 and z2 and estimate parameters Œ≤1, Œ≤2 , A and \phi. 
4.  Plot x, fitted line. 

### Question 6
<h4> Question 6 </h4>
Q. 6) Suppose the transition probabilities are a function of the age of a person. The transition 
probability of a person aged x moving:
* from Healthy to Sick state is 0.007x 
* from Healthy to Death state is 0.001x 
* from Sick to Death state is 0.002(100-x) 
* from Sick to Healthy is 0.006(100-x). 

#### Exercises

Assuming 100 is the maximum age. Calculate the probability of: 
1.  Healthy person aged 30 will be in Sick state after 4 years. (9)

2.   Sick person aged 25 will be in Death state after 7 years. 

### Exercise 7
Q. 7) An extract from the data for 15 patients monitored in hospital after every 15 minutes post 
giving them a dosage of life saving drug is shown in the table below. 

<pre><code>
Person Last time at which patient was 
observed (time unit in 15 Minutes) Outcome
1 6 (i.e. 90 minutes) Died
2 6 Discharged
3 12 Died
4 18 Discharged
5 27 Died
6 27 Discharged
7 30 Discharged
8 36 Discharged
9 39 Died
10 39 Discharged
11 54 Discharged
12 57 Died
13 60 Survived
14 60 Survived
15 60 Survived
</code></pre>
#### Exercises
1.  Use the data to create the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function. Use the 
‚ÄúSurvival‚Äù library in R to create the summary of the model (survival rates, standard 
deviation, lower 95% confidence interval, upper 95% confidence interval). 
2.   Use the results of the summary created in (1.  and input the values of tj, dj and nj in the 
model to calculate the estimated integrated hazard and hence the Nelson ‚Äê Aalen 
estimate of the survival model. 
3.    Create a table to compare the above two analysis. 

### Exercise 8
Q. 8) Consider a set of data generated by tossing a fair coin, letting xt = 1 when a head is obtained 
and xt = ‚àí1 when a tail is obtained. Then, construct yt as
yt = 2 + 1.5xt ‚àí 0.5xt‚àí1

#### Exercises 
Simulate data for three cases, one with a small sample size (n = 10), another one with a 
moderate sample size (n = 100) and lastly with large sample size (n = 1000).
1.  Plot the series for all three cases. 
2.   Find the mean and variance and comment on results.
