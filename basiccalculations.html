Basic Calculations

We will briefly look at how R accomplished basic calculations. 


x=10 ; y =5 ; z=2

x*y			# multiplication
x/z			# division

x^2			# powers
sqrt(x)		# square root

exp(z)		# exponentials   
log(y)		# logarithms

pi             # returns the value of pi to 6 decimal places

 
R can handle more advanced calculations too, such as complex numbers , trigonometric functions, factorials and binomial coefficients.

When working with complex numbers, the data type needs to specified as complex, rather than numeric. 

Binomial coefficients (e.g. 6C2) are computed using the choose() command.


J = -1   
sqrt(J)  
str(J)      # variable is defined as numeric, not complex.

K = -1 +0i 
sqrt(K)  
str(K)      # variable is defined as complex .


sin(3.5*pi)       # correct answer is -1
cos(3.5*pi)       # correct answer is zero
 

factorial(6)      # Factorial

choose(6,2)       # From 6 how many ways of choosing 2 items.
