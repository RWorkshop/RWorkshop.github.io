\section{Summary Outputs}
The \texttt{summaryFunction} argument is used to pas in a function that takes the observed and predicted
values and estimate some measure of performance. Two such functions are already included in the
package: defaultSummary and twoClassSummary. 

The latter will compute measures speciﬁc to two–class
problems, such as the area under the ROC curve, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity. Since the ROC
curve is based on the predicted class probabilities (which are not computed automatically), another
option is required. The classProbs = TRUE option is used to include these calculations.
