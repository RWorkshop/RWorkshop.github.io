<h5>Data Frames</h5>

A data frame

<ul>
<li> can be thought of as a data matrix or data set;
<li>
 is a generalization of a matrix;
<li>
 is a list of vectors and/or factors of the same length;
<li>
 has a unique set of row names
</ul>


Data in the same position across columns come from the same experimental unit.


We can create data frames from pre-existing variables:

<pre><code>
> d <- data.frame(mean_weight, Gender)
</code></pre>


Data set : mtcars


R contains several embedded data sets. One that is commonly used is mtcars

<pre><code>
>mtcars
</code></pre>

(for some background on mtcars, type ?mtcars)


Each of the columns has a name. Use the commands <code>names()</code> and <code>dim()</code> to find more information about mtcars.


Another useful command is <code>summary()</code>.  It will give revelant information on the data object.



We can use the command rownames() to access the names of each row.


To access a particular column, use the dollar sign to specify it
<pre><code>
>mtcars$mpg
</code></pre>

We can now perform calculations on this column.
