### The Exponential Distribution

#### The Exponential Distribution
#### Definitions

An exponentially distributed random variable $X$ is specifed with the ***rate parameter*** $\lambda$
$$ X \sim \mbox{exp}(\lambda)  $$
The  Expected Value of X is computed using the following formula
$$ E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$

### Worked Example
####Description

A machine is said to have a mean failure free lifetime of 2000 hours. It is assumed that the failure free lifetimes of the machines have an exponential distribution. 
What is the probability that the machine will last:

#### Exercises 

1. at least 1000 hours
2. at least 1500 hours
3. less than 800 hours
4. between 1300 hours and 1800 hours
