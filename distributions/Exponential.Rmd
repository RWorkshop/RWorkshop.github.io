### The Exponential Distribution

<h3>The Exponential Distribution</h3>

The exponential distribution describes the arrival time of a randomly recurring independent event sequence. If $\mu$ is the mean ``duration" or ``waiting time" for the next event recurrence, 
its probability density function is given as

\[
f(x;\lambda) = \begin{cases}
\lambda e^{-\lambda x}, & x \ge 0, \\
0, & x < 0.
\end{cases}\]

The parameter $\lambda$  is called \textbf{\emph{rate}} parameter. It is the inverse of the expected duration ($\mu$).\\
\[\mu= \frac{1}{\lambda}\].The cumulative distribution function of an exponential distribution is

\[
F(x;\lambda) = \begin{cases}
1-e^{-\lambda x}, & x \ge 0, \\
0, & x < 0.
\end{cases}\]

If the expected duration is 5 ( e.g. five minutes) then the rate parameter value is 0.2. When implemented with ***R***, the exponential distribution is characterized by the 
single parameter <code>rate}}.The commands follow the same kind of naming convention, and the names of the commands are <code>dexp()</code>, <code>pexp()</code>, <code>qexp()</code>, and <code>rexp()</code>. A few examples are given below to show how to use the various commands.

<h4>Exponential Distribution : Problem</h4>
Suppose the mean checkout time of a supermarket cashier is three minutes. Find the probability of a customer checkout being completed by the cashier in less than two minutes, three minutes and four minutes. 
(i.e. what percentage of ``waiting times" are less than two, three and four minutes?)

<br><i>Solution</b></i><br>
The checkout processing rate is equals to one divided by the mean checkout completion time. 
Hence the processing rate is 1/3 checkouts per minute. We then apply the function \texttt{\textbf{pexp()}} of the exponential distribution with rate=1/3. 
Also compute the probability that the waiting time exceeds 5 minutes.
<pre><code>
> pexp(2,rate=1/3)
[1] 0.4865829
> pexp(3,rate=1/3)
[1] 0.6321206
> pexp(4,rate=1/3)
[1] 0.7364029
> pexp(5,rate=1/3,lower=FALSE)
[1] 0.1888756
</code></pre>
The probabilities of finishing a checkout in under two, three and four minutes by the cashier are approximately 48.6 \%, 63.21\% and 73.6\% respectively. 

What is the median waiting time? To answer this question we would use the \texttt{\textbf{qexp()}} function. Recall that the median is value of $x$ such that $P(X \leq x) = 0.50$.
Also determine the first and third quartiles $Q_1$ and $Q_3$.
<pre><code>
> qexp(0.5,rate=1/3)
[1] 2.079442
> qexp(0.25,rate=1/3)
[1] 0.8630462
> qexp(0.75,rate=1/3)
[1] 4.158883
</code></pre>

### Worked Examples
#### The Exponential Distribution
#### Definitions

An exponentially distributed random variable $X$ is specifed with the ***rate parameter*** $\lambda$
$$ X \sim \mbox{exp}(\lambda)  $$
The  Expected Value of X is computed using the following formula
$$ E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda} $$

### Worked Example
####Description

A machine is said to have a mean failure free lifetime of 2000 hours. It is assumed that the failure free lifetimes of the machines have an exponential distribution. 
What is the probability that the machine will last:

#### Exercises 

1. at least 1000 hours
2. at least 1500 hours
3. less than 800 hours
4. between 1300 hours and 1800 hours
