<h4>Question  1</h4>

Negative Binomial Experiment
A negative binomial experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties:

The experiment consists of x repeated trials.
Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure.
The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial.
The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.
The experiment continues until r successes are observed, where r is specified in advance.
