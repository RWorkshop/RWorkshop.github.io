### Question 1

<h4>Question  1</h4>

In a very small empirical study a sample from a random variable X is observed. The 
data can be entered into R using the following code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
x <- c(0.22,0.38,1.28,0.54,0.56,1.36,0.55,0.37,0.43,0.46,0.62,
0.54,0.54,0.51,0.44,0.68,0.55,0.30)
```

#### Exercises 
1. Estimate the expected value of $X$. 

2. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the expected value of $X$ assuming that $X$ is Normally distributed. 

3. Construct a confidence interval for the expected value of $X$ using the bootstrap 
method with 10,000 bootstrap replications.

4. Comment on the differences between the confidence intervals in exercises 2  and 3.
