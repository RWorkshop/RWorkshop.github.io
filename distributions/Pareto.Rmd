### Pareto Distribution

<h4>Question  1</h4>

The probability that India will win a cricket match against South Africa is 0.7

#### Exercise 1
Prepare a probability distribution table of number of wins if Indians are going to play 10
matches against the South Africans. 

#### Exercise 2
Plot a bar chart of the probabilities of number of wins from 0 to 10. 

#### Exercise 3
Find the mean and median number of wins for India against South Africa.


### Pareto Distribution - Worked Examples

<h4> Worked Example 1</h4>

The claim severity for an auto liability insurance coverage is modeled by a Pareto Type I distribution with shape parameter $\alpha=2.5$ and scale parameter $\theta=1000$. 
The insurance coverage pays up to a limit of 1200 per claim. 

Using a seed of 1234, simulate the nominal value of 50,000 such insurance claims.
Estimate the expected insurance payment under this coverage for one claim.
