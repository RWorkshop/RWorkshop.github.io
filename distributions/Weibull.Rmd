### Introduction

The Weibull distribution is a continuous probability distribution that can fit an extensive range of distribution shapes. Like the normal distribution, the Weibull distribution describes the probabilities associated with continuous data. However, unlike the normal distribution, it can also model skewed data. In fact, its extreme flexibility allows it to model both left- and right-skewed data.

It can even approximate the normal distribution and other distributions. Because of its flexibility, analysts use it in a broad range of settings, such as quality control, capability analysis, medical studies, and engineering. Itâ€™s frequently used in life data, reliability analysis, and warranty analysis to assess time to failure for systems and parts.

### Worked Example

<h4>Worked Example</h4>



The lifetime $X$ (in hundreds of hours) of a certain type of industrial vacuum tube has a Weibull distribution with parameters $\alpha = 2.5$ and $\beta = 200$. 


Using a seed of 1234, simulate 10,000 randomly generated lifetimes, and undertake the following exercises.

#### Exercises

Estimate the following:

1. $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$
2. $P(X\leq 200)$
3. $P(180\leq X \leq 250)$
4. $P(X\geq 300)$.
