\subsubsection{CSV File}
The sample data can be in \textit{\textbf{comma separated values}} (CSV) format. Each cell inside such data file is separated by a special character, which usually is a comma, although other characters can be used as well. ( As it is vendor neutral, CSV is more versatile).
The first row of the data file should contain the column names instead of the actual data. Here is a sample of the expected format.
\begin{verbatim}
Col1,Col2,Col3
100,a1,b1
200,a2,b2
300,a3,b3
\end{verbatim}

After we copy and paste the data above in a file named ``MyData.csv" with a text editor, we can read the data with the \texttt{read.csv()} function. (The file should be in the working directory).
\begin{verbatim}
> mydata = read.csv("MyData.csv")  # read csv file
> mydata                           # print data frame
  Col1 Col2 Col3
1  100   a1   b1
2  200   a2   b2
3  300   a3   b3
\end{verbatim}
(Remark: In various European locales, as the comma character serves as decimal point, the \texttt{read.csv2()} function should be used instead.)

\bigskip
\noindent \textbf{Exercise:} Load the GNW dataset into the \texttt{R} Environment. (We will do more work with it shortly).

\subsubsection{Data export - \texttt{write.csv()}}
The basic tool to produce output files is \texttt{write.csv()}.

The only two required arguments to \texttt{write.csv()} are ,firstly, the name of a dataset or matrix (with just a single argument) then the name (in quotations) of the file to be created.

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> getwd()
[1] "C:/Users/Kevin/Documents"
> write.csv(iris,"iris2")
> 
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
%Usually, the second argument, file= will be used to specify the destination as either a character string to represent a file, or a connection (i.e. database connectivity).

%By default, character strings are surrounded by quotes by write.table(); use the quote=FALSE argument to suppress this feature. To suppress row names or column names from being written to the file, use the row.names=FALSE or col.names=FALSE arguments, respectively.

%Note that col.names=TRUE (the default) produces the same sort of headers that are read using the header=TRUE argument of read.table().

The  \texttt{sep=} argument can be used to specify a separator other than a blank space. Using sep=',' (comma separated) or sep=`\textbackslash t' (tab-separated) are two common choices.



\subsubsection{Data export - \texttt{sink()}}


The code first instructs \texttt{R} to re-direct output away from the \texttt{R} terminal to the file "output.txt" and
then the relevant output  (below the summary of the GNW data frame) which goes to the sink.
To close the sink, use
\texttt{sink()} with no arguments.

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
 sink("GNW.txt")
 summary(GNW)
sink()
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}


While a sink is open all output will go to it, replacing what is already in the file. To append output
to a file, use the \texttt{append=TRUE} option with \texttt{sink()}. 

(Here we will use the \texttt{describe()} command from the \textbf{\textit{psych}} packages)

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
install.packages("psych")
library(psych)
 
sink("GNW.txt",append=TRUE)
describe(GNW)
sink()
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\subsection{Inputting an \texttt{R} script - the \texttt{source()} command}
The \texttt{source()}function runs a previously written R script in the current session. If the filename does not include a path ( such as “C:/WorkArea”) the file is taken from the current working directory. This is a particularly useful for loading pre-written data or functions  (from  later on), and other items of code into the current session.

\begin{verbatim}
# input a few scripts
source("mypackages.R")
source("myfunctions.R")
source("mydata.R")
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{ Using the \texttt{scan()} command}
The\texttt{scan()}  function is a useful method of inputting data quickly. You can use to quickly copy and paste values into the R environment.
It is best used in the manner as described in the following example.  Create a variable “X” and use the \texttt{scan()}  function to populate it with values.
Type in a value, and then press return.
Once you have entered all the values, press return again to return to normal operation.
\begin{verbatim}
> X=scan()
1: 4
2: 5
3: 5
4: 6
5: 
Read 4 items
\end{verbatim}
For the data that has been scanned,  equivalent code that would be used to define it can be retrieved and recorded using the \texttt{edit()} command.
