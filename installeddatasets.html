 Installed Data sets
To assist in the demonstration of statistical methodologies, there are several dozen embedded data sets installed automatically with R.
To view the list of such data sets currently available, type in data() to the command line.
One data set we will be using frequently is the Iris data set.

(To view the column names, and the first six cases, we will use the command head(). To view the last six cases, use the command tail() ).

While we will be covering very little material relevant to graphics, it is worth nothing how many colours are supported by R.  To get a full list of currently supported colours, type in the command colours().
