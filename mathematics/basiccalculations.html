<h3>Basic Calculations</h3>

We will briefly look at how R accomplished basic calculations. 

<pre><code>
x=10 ; y =5 ; z=2

x*y			# multiplication
x/z			# division

x^2			# powers
sqrt(x)		# square root

exp(z)		# exponentials   
log(y)		# logarithms

pi             # returns the value of pi to 6 decimal places
</code></pre>
 
R can handle more advanced calculations too, such as complex numbers , trigonometric functions, factorials and binomial coefficients.

When working with complex numbers, the data type needs to specified as complex, rather than numeric. 

Binomial coefficients are computed using the <code>choose()</code> command.


J = -1   
sqrt(J)  
str(J)      # variable is defined as numeric, not complex.

K = -1 +0i 
sqrt(K)  
str(K)      # variable is defined as complex .


sin(3.5*pi)       # correct answer is -1
cos(3.5*pi)       # correct answer is zero
 
<pre><code>
factorial(6)      # Factorial

choose(6,2)       # From 6 how many ways of choosing 2 items.
</code></pre>
