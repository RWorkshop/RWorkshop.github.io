For matrices, addition and subtraction works on an element- wise basis. 

The first elements of the respective matrices are added, and so on.

Matrix Multiplication


To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; “%*%”. 


If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
