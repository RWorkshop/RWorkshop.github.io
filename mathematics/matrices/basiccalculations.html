For matrices, addition and subtraction works on an element- wise basis. 

The first elements of the respective matrices are added, and so on.

A+B
A-B

Matrix Multiplication
To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; "%*%".
If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
A * B  		#Element-wise multiplication
A %*% B  	#Matrix multiplication
We can compute crossproducts using the crossprod () command. If only one matrix is used it
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
crossprod(A,B) 		# A'B
crossprod(A) 			# A'A
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}



Matrix Multiplication


To multiply matrices, we require a special operator for matrices; “%*%”. 


If we just used the normal multiplication, we would get an element-wise multiplication.
