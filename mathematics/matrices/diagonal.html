Diagonals
The diag() command is a very versatile function for using matrices.
It can be used to create a diagonal matrix with elements of a vector in the principal diagonal. For an existing matrix, it can be used to return a vector containing the elements of the principal diagonal.


Most importantly, if k is a scalar, diag() will create a k x k identity matrix.

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
Vec2=c(1,2,3)
diag(Vec2)	#	Constructs a diagonal matrix based on values of Vec2
diag(A)	#        Returns diagonal elements of A as a vector
diag(3)	#	creates a 3 x 3 identity matrix
diag(diag(A)) #  	Diagonal matrix D of matrix A ( Jacobi Method)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
