\subsection{Linear Algebra Functions}
R supports many import linear algebra functions such as cholesky decomposition, trace, rank, eigenvalues etc. The required results may be determinable from the output of a command that pertains to an overall approach.
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed using the eigen() function. 

A data object known as a list is then created.
eigen(A) #eigenvalues and eigenvectors qr(A) 
#returns Rank of a matrix svd(A)
This is a very important type of matrix analysis, and many will encounter it again in future modules. 

Y = eigen(A) 
names(Y) # y$val are the eigenvalues of A # y$vec are the eigenvectors of A

# Eigen Analysis

y<-eigen(A) 
y$val #There are the eigenvalues of A
y$vec #These are the eigenvectors of A
