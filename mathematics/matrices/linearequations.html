Determinants, Inverse Matrices and solving Linear systems
To compute the determinant of a square matrix, we simply use the det() command
det(A)
det(B)
To find the inverse of a square matrix, we use the solve() command, specifying only the matrix in question
solve(A)

To solve a system of linear equations in the form Ax=b , where A is a square matrix, and b is a column vector of known values, we use the solve() command to determine the values of the unknown vector x.
b=vec2  # from before
solve(A, b)
