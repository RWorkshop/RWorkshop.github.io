{Diagonals and the Identity Matrix}

The diag() command is a very versatile function for using matrices.

It can be used to create a diagonal matrix with elements of a vector in the 
principal diagonal. For an existing matrix, it can be used to return a vector 
containing the elements of the principal diagonal.

Most importantly, if k is a scalar (i.e. single number such as 3) , 
diag() will create a k x k identity matrix.

<code>

Vec2=c(1,2,3)

diag(Vec2)     #      Constructs a diag. matrix based on Vec2

diag(A)        #     Returns diagonal elements of A as a vector

diag(3)        #     Creates a 3 x 3 identity matrix

diag(diag(A))  #     Creates the diagonal matrix D of matrix A
</code>
