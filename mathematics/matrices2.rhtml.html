<h3>Creating a matrix</h3>
Matrices can be created using the <code>matrix()</code> command. The arguments to be supplied are 1) vector of values to be entered
2) Dimensions of the matrix, specifying either the numbers of rows or columns.

Additionally you can specify if the values are to be allocated by row or column. By default they are allocated by column.
<!--begin.rcode
Vec1=c(1,4,5,6,4,5,5,7,9)		# 9 elements
A=matrix(Vec,nrow=3)		#3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by column.
A
B= matrix(c(1,6,7,0.6,0.5,0.3,1,2,1),ncol=3,byrow =TRUE)
B				          #3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by row.
end.rcode-->	
If you have assigned values by column, but require that they are assigned by row, you can use the transpose function
<!--begin.rcode
t().
t(A)				# Transpose
A=t(A)	
end.rcode-->



	Matrices can be created using the <code>matrix()</code> command. The arguments to be supplied are
	1. vector of values to be entered.
	2. dimensions of the matrix, specifying either the numbers of rows or columns.
	Additionally you can specify if the values are to be allocated by row or column. 
	By default they are allocated by column.
<!--begin.rcode
	Vec1 = c(1,4,5,6,4,5,5,7,9) 
	# 9 elements A = matrix(Vec1,nrow=3) 
	#3 by 3 matrix, assigned by column. A 
	
end.rcode-->
	Notice how the rows and column are preceded with row and column indexes. 
	To assign by row, we must specify it by setting the appropriate argument accordingly.
	
	#3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by row. 

<!--begin.rcode
	C= matrix( c(1,6,7,0.6,0.5,0.3,1,2,1), ncol=3 , byrow =TRUE) C [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1.0 6.0 7.0 [2,] 0.6 0.5 0.3 [3,] 1.0 2.0 1.0
	
end.rcode-->


	
<h3>Accessing Rows and Columns<h3>
	
	Particular rows and columns of a data object (matrix as well as other objects such as data frames) 
	can be accessed by specifying the row number or column number, leaving the other value blank.
	A[1,] # access first row of A #[1] 1 6 5 C[,2] # access second column of C #[1] 6.0 0.5 2.0
	Naturally - particular elements may be accessed by specifying the row number and column number A[1,1] # [1] 1 # This is not just for matrices. 
	
	# It is for all suitable data objects. iris[,1] iris[,1:3] iris[2,] iris[2,3] mtcars[2:5,4:6]
	



<h4> Determining the dimensions</h4>

To find the dimensions of matrix A, we use the dim() command
<h4>Compute the transpose </h4>
To compute the transpose of matrix A, we use the command t(). 

det(C) #[1] 3 dim(C) # number of rows and columns. t(C) [,1] [,2] [,3] [1,] 1 0.6 1 [2,] 6 0.5 2 [3,] 7 0.3 1
	5) Cross Products and Kronecker Product We can compute cross products using the crossprod() command. The Kronecker product ( a very useful command in numerical computation) is easily implementable using the kronecker() command. crossprod(A,C) kronecker(A,C) kronecker(C,A)
	
	


	
	
	




Particular rows and columns can be accessed by specifying the row number or column number, leaving the other value blank.
<!--begin.rcode
A[1,]	  # access first row of A
B[,2]   # access first column of B
end.rcode-->

		<h3>Creating a matrix}
		Matrices can be created using the <code>matrix()</code> command. The arguments to be supplied are 1) vector of values to be entered
		2) Dimensions of the matrix, specifying either the numbers of rows or columns.
		
		Additionally you can specify if the values are to be allocated by row or column. By default they are allocated by column.
		<!--begin.rcode
		Vec1=c(1,4,5,6,4,5,5,7,9)		# 9 elements
		A=matrix(Vec,nrow=3)		#3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by column.
		A
		B= matrix(c(1,6,7,0.6,0.5,0.3,1,2,1),ncol=3,byrow =TRUE)
		B				          #3 by 3 matrix. Values assigned by row.
		end.rcode-->	
		If you have assigned values by column, but require that they are assigned by row, you can use the transpose function
		<!--begin.rcode
		t().
		t(A)				# Transpose
		A=t(A)	
		end.rcode-->
		
		Another methods of creating a matrix is to "bind" a number of vectors together, either by row or by column. The commands are rbind() and cbind() respectively.
		<!--begin.rcode
		x1 =c(1,2) ; x2 = c(3,6)
		rbind(x1,x2)
		cbind(x1,x2)
		end.rcode-->
		
		
			
			Particular rows and columns can be accessed by specifying the row number or column number, leaving the other value blank.
			<!--begin.rcode
			A[1,]	  # access first row of A
			B[,2]   # access first column of B
			end.rcode-->


		
		A particular row can be accessed by specifying the row index , while leaving the column index empty
		
		<!--begin.rcode
		Info [4,]			# Fourth row of "Info" is called
		
		A sequence of rows can be accessed by specifying a sequence of rows as follows.
		
		Info [10:15,]		# tenth row to fifteenth row of "Info" is called
		
	end.rcode-->
