Installation
===================================================

Thanks for your interest in the ***GIS with R*** Workshop 

* In order to prepare for the workshop, we ask you to try out the following three steps before the workshop. 
* If you are not able to, please attend the online preparation sessions, and we can help you with the process.

### Step 1 - Download R
In advance of the workshop, it would be great if you could install R.
R can be installed for this website.

http://ftp.heanet.ie/mirrors/cran.r-project.org/

The process is very simple, and should only take two or three minutes. Select the default options when necessary.

### Step 2 - Rstudio

Best practice among data science professionals is to write, review and manage their code using an ***Integrated Development Environment (IDE)***. For R programmers, the most popular IDE is ***RStudio***.

For this workshop, we ask you to download and install ***Rstudio*** from this website.

http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Again the process should be very quick. Select the default options when downloading and installing R.

### Step 3 - Important R packages

* In advance of the workshop install some <tt>R</tt> packages that we will use on the day.

* All you have to do is to open <tt>R</tt> (making sure that you are connected to the internet), and run the following piece of code in RStudio. 

```{r eval = FALSE}

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("terra")

```

* This process can take about 10 to 15 minutes, as there are many background processes being run sequentially.

* R packages can also be installed from R Studio by clicking on the ***Tools*** menu and selecting install packages. A dialogue box will appear.
