4.3. The Binomial Distribution
There are four functions that can be used to generate the values associated with the binomial distribution. You can get a full list of them and their options using the help command:

> help(Binomial)
These commands work just like the commands for the normal distribution. The binomial distribution requires two extra parameters, the number of trials and the probability of success for a single trial. The commands follow the same kind of naming convention, and the names of the commands are dbinom, pbinom, qbinom, and rbinom.

A few examples are given below to show how to use the different commands. First we have the distribution function, dbinom:

> x <- seq(0,50,by=1)
> y <- dbinom(x,50,0.2)
> plot(x,y)
> y <- dbinom(x,50,0.6)
> plot(x,y)
> x <- seq(0,100,by=1)
> y <- dbinom(x,100,0.6)
> plot(x,y)
Next we have the cumulative probability distribution function:

> pbinom(24,50,0.5)
[1] 0.4438624
> pbinom(25,50,0.5)
[1] 0.5561376
> pbinom(25,51,0.5)
[1] 0.5
> pbinom(26,51,0.5)
[1] 0.610116
> pbinom(25,50,0.5)
[1] 0.5561376
> pbinom(25,50,0.25)
[1] 0.999962
> pbinom(25,500,0.25)
[1] 4.955658e-33
Next we have the inverse cumulative probability distribution function:

> qbinom(0.5,51,1/2)
[1] 25
> qbinom(0.25,51,1/2)
[1] 23
> pbinom(23,51,1/2)
[1] 0.2879247
> pbinom(22,51,1/2)
[1] 0.200531
Finally random numbers can be generated according to the binomial distribution:

> rbinom(5,100,.2)
[1] 30 23 21 19 18
> rbinom(5,100,.7)
[1] 66 66 58 68 63
