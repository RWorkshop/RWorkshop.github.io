<h2>Grubbs' Test</h2>
Grubbs' test is a formal hypothesis test for assessing whether or not a  data set contains an outlier.
This data set is univariate and approximately normal distributed. This test is designed for assessing one outlier only.  If more outliers are suspected, alternative tests, such as the Tietjen-Moore test, are recommended.

<h4>Hypotheses:</h4> Grubbs' test is defined for the hypothesis: 


Ho :  There are no outliers in the data set  
Ha :  There is exactly one outlier in the data set

	<h2>Assumption of Normality</h2>

One of the assumptions of many statistical procedures (including the t- test) is that the population from which you are sampling is normally distributed. The t-test is said to be rather ‘robust’ in terms of this assumption, which means that reality can deviate from this assumption a fair amount without seriously affecting the validity of the analysis. 

This is particularly true when the size of the samples is large (thanks to the Central Limit Theorem). Some deviations from normality can pose a problem for the t-test, specifically those that involve getting extreme scores more frequently than you would if the distribution were normal. 
Statistical Software Packages provides two statistical tests for deviation from normality, the 'Kolomogorov-Smirnov' family of tests and the 'Shapiro-Wilk' test. 
The 'Kolomogorov-Smirnov' test can be used to test if two data sets are distributed according to the same distribution. It can also be used to test if one data set comes from a specified distribution, such as the normal distribution. ( As such, the normal distribution must be specified as an argument to the function.)
For the purposes of this module, we will only use a special case of the 'Kolomogorov-Smirnov' test, known as the ‘ Anderson-Darling' test of normality.
The ‘Anderson-Darling’ test can not be implemented directly in R. Using the test requires the installation of the nortest package. We will look at packages in greater detail later in the semester.

The null hypothesis of both the `Anderson-Darling’ and `Shapiro-Wilk’ tests is that the population is normally distributed, and the alternative hypothesis is that the data is not normally distributed. 




Let us use both tests to assess whether the titration data set (the combined scores from all four students as one data set) is normally distributed.
Judging by this histogram – do you think the data set is normally distributed? 
(Remark : it is skewed to the right)
 
 

Using the ‘Shapiro-Wilk’ Test
> Ttrns = c(X.A, X.B, X.C, X.D)
> shapiro.test(Ttrns)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  Ttrns 
W = 0.9188, p-value = 0.09394

Using the ‘Anderson-Darling’ Test
<pre><code>
> library(nortest)
> ad.test(Ttrns)

        Anderson-Darling normality test

data:  Ttrns 
A = 0.6961, p-value = 0.0583
</code></pre>
In both cases we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data set is normally distributed.
However, the p-values were still quite low in both cases.
 
<h3>Limitations of Tests</h3>
There are some important limitations to the usefulness of these tests.

If you reject H0 you can conclude that the population is not normally distributed, but if you don't reject H0 then you only conclude that you failed to show the population is not normally distributed. In other words, you can prove the population is not normally distributed but you can't prove it is normally distributed.

Rejecting H0 means that the population is not normally distributed, but it doesn't tell you whether it is because it is a fat-tailed distribution, a thin-tailed distribution, a skewed distribution, or something else. 

The tests are influenced by power. If you have a small sample the test may not have enough power to detect non-normality in the population.

	
	\chapter{Testing for Normality}
\section{Shapiro-Wilk Test}
The first test we will look at is the Shapiro-Wilk test.
\begin{verbatim}
> shapiro.test(Vec)

        Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  Vec
W = 0.9888, p-value = 0.5727
\end{verbatim}
As the p-value is very high, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data set ``Vec" is normally distributed.



\section{Kolmogorov-Smirnov test}
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is defined by:
\\
H$_0$:     The data follow a specified distribution\\
H$_1$:     The data do not follow the specified distribution\\

Test Statistic:     The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is defined as

where F is the theoretical cumulative distribution of the distribution being tested which must be a continuous distribution (i.e., no discrete distributions such as the binomial or Poisson), and it must be fully specified

\subsection{ Characteristics and Limitations of the K-S Test}


An attractive feature of this test is that the distribution of the K-S test statistic itself does not depend on the underlying cumulative distribution function being tested. Another advantage is that it is an exact test (the chi-square goodness-of-fit test depends on an adequate sample size for the approximations to be valid). Despite these advantages, the K-S test has several important limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It only applies to continuous distributions.
	\item It tends to be more sensitive near the center of the distribution than at the tails.
	\item Perhaps the most serious limitation is that the distribution must be fully specified. That is, if location, scale, and shape parameters are estimated from the data, the critical region of the K-S test is no longer valid. It typically must be determined by simulation.
\end{enumerate}
Due to limitations 2 and 3 above, many analysts prefer to use the Anderson-Darling goodness-of-fit test.

However, the Anderson-Darling test is only available for a few specific distributions.

\section{The AndersonDarling test}

The AndersonDarling test is a statistical test of whether there is evidence that a given sample of data did not arise from a given probability distribution.

In its basic form, the test assumes that there are no parameters to be estimated in the distribution being tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values is distribution-free. However, the test is most often used in contexts where a family of distributions is being tested, in which case the parameters of that family need to be estimated and account must be taken of this in adjusting either the test-statistic or its critical values.

When applied to testing if a normal distribution adequately describes a set of data, it is one of the most powerful statistical tools for detecting most departures from normality.

\section{The Shapiro-Wilk test of normality}
Performs the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality.
<pre><code>
> x<- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 3)
> shapiro.test(x)

Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = 3)
W = 0.9818, p-value = 0.1834
</code></pre>
In this case, the p-value is greater than 0.05, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the
data set is normally distributed.
<pre><code>
>y <- runif(100, min = 2, max = 4)
> shapiro.test(y)

Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  runif(100, min = 2, max = 4)
W = 0.9499, p-value = 0.0008215
</code></pre>
In this case, the p-value is less than 0.05, so we reject the null hypothesis that the
data set is normally distributed.

<h4>Testing for Normality</h4>

There are a number of different ways of checking whether a data set is normally distributed. 

In each of these procedures, the test is structured as follows
Ho: Data is normally distributed
Ha: Data is not normally distributed

A well recognized test for testing whether a data set is normally distributed is the Anderson-Darling test. Implementing this test requires you to download the nortest package from CRAN. [Go to http://cran.r-project.org/ > Packages > nortest.]

The package must be loaded into R by clicking Packages > Install packages from local zip files and locating nortest. Once the package has been loaded, can then use library(nortest) to access the functions.

The Anderson-Darling test is carried out using:
<pre><code>
ad.test(data$y)
Anderson-Darling normality test
data: data$y
A = 0.1634, p-value = 0.9421

#Remember what this test is doing!!
#H0 : The data are normally distributed.
#H1 : The data are not normally distributed.
</code></pre>
<p>

Since the p-value is 0.9421 > 0.05 ,there is not enough evidence to reject Ho ,so we conclude that the data is normally distributed.
Instead of the Anderson Darling test, we can use Shapiro Wilk test. This test can be implemented using the base installation. 

<pre><code>
> shapiro.test(mod)

Shapiro-Wilk normality test

data:  mod 
W = 0.9186, p-value = 0.3457
</code></pre>
Here we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the data set “mod” is normally distributed.
