\subsection{Paired t-test}
% (Population Mean between paired samples)
Two data samples aresaid to be paired (or matched) if they come from repeated observations of the same subject. Here, we assume that the data populations follow the normal distribution.

Using the paired t-test, we can obtain an interval estimate of the difference of the population means. Necessarily there must be equal numbers of elements in both sets.

The \textbf{\texttt{t.test()}} function can be used to perform paired t-tests, by making the appropriate specification:\textbf{\texttt{paired=TRUE}}.


\subsubsection{Example}
In the built-in data set named \textbf{\emph{immer}}, the barley yield in years 1931 and 1932 of the same field are recorded. In the intervening period, fertilizer treatments were applied to each field. The motivation of the study was to determine whether or not the treatment was effective.

The yield data are presented in the data frame columns $Y1$ and $Y2$.

\begin{verbatim}
> library(MASS)         # load the MASS package
> head(immer)
   Loc  Var    Y1    Y2
1  UF   M      81.0  80.7
2  UF   S      105.4  82.3
   .....
\end{verbatim}
Assuming that the data in immer follows the normal distribution, find the $95\%$ confidence interval estimate of the difference between the mean barley yields.

We apply the t.test function to compute the difference in means of the matched samples. As it is a paired test, we set the ``paired" argument as TRUE.

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
attach(immer)
t.test(Y1,Y2, paired=TRUE)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\begin{verbatim}

        Paired t-test

data:  Y1 and Y2
t = 3.324, df = 29, p-value = 0.002413
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
  6.121954 25.704713
sample estimates:
mean of the differences
               15.91333
\end{verbatim}
Between years 1931 and 1932 in the data set immer, the 95\% confidence interval of the difference in means of the barley yields is the interval between 6.122 and 25.705.
One can conclude that the fertilizer treatments were successful in improving the yield of barley.
