<h3>Diagnostic Plots</h3>

You can also easily view diagnostic plots (residuals, observed vs fitted, Cook's distance, etc.): 
> plot(lmfit)
R knows that this is the output from a linear model and will generate the appropriate plots. How does it know? Check to see what class it is: 
> class(lmfit)
[1] "lm"
You can get the coefficients from your model fit with the coef() function: 
> coef(lmfit)
(Intercept)        conc 
0.004303145 0.259602617
These are estimates for the parameters we called a and b, respectively. The output from <code>coef()</code> is just a vector of length 2. Let's use the coefficients to add a line to our graph of ytrans vs conc: 
<pre><code>
> plot(df$conc, df$ytrans)
> abline(coef(lmfit))
</code></pre>
Here's what it looks like:

The last thing we have to do is back-calculate to get our non-linear parameters, Vm and K: 
<pre><code>
> Vm <- 1/coef(lmfit)[2]
> K <- Vm*coef(lmfit)[1]
> Vm
conc 
3.852041 
> K
conc 
0.01657589 
</code></pre>
Remember that the output from the coef function is a vector of length 2 so we can access the desired coefficient using the brackets as shown. We now have our parameter estimates! 

<h4>Homoscedascity</h4>
\textbf{\emph{Homoscedascity }}(constant variance) is one of the assumptions required in a regression analysis in order to make valid statistical inferences about population relationships.

Homoscedasticity requires that the variance of the residuals are constant for all fitted values, indicated by a uniform scatter or dispersion of data points about the trend line (i.e. ``The Zero Line").
<p>
From the above plot, we can conclude that the constant variance assumption is valid. We can see that the mean value of the residuals is zero.
<pre><code>
