\subsection{Diagnostic Plots}
\textbf{\emph{Homoscedascity }}(constant variance) is one of the assumptions required in a regression analysis in order to make valid statistical inferences about population relationships.

Homoscedasticity requires that the variance of the residuals are constant for all fitted values, indicated by a uniform scatter or dispersion of data points about the trend line (i.e. ``The Zero Line").

From the above plot, we can conclude that the constant variance assumption is valid. We can see that the mean value of the residuals is zero.
