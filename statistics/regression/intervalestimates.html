<h3>Confidence and Prediction Intervals for Fitted Values</h3>

Recall that a fitted value $\hat{Y}$ is a estimate for the response variable, as determined by a linear model. The difference between the observed value and the corresponding fitted value is known as the residual.

The \textbf{\emph{residual standard error}} is the conditional standard deviation of the dependent variable Y given a value of the independent variable X. The calculation of this standard error follows from the definition of the residuals.

The residual standard error is often called the root mean square error (RMSE), and is a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model or an estimator and the values actually observed from the thing being modelled or estimated.

Since the residual standard error is a good measure of accuracy, it is ideal if it is small.


<h3>Prediction</h3>
Suppose we want to know the predicted value ^y at x = 30. Could
write out the equation using the parameter estimates and ll in the
required value for x:
<pre><code>
19.94379 + 2.07497*30
[1] 82.19289
Alternatively, could use the predict function:
predict(model,list(x=30))
1
82.19289
</code></pre>

For linear plots use abline for superimposing the model on a
scatterplot of the data points. For curved responses, use the
predict function to generate the lines.

<h3>Confidence and Prediction Intervals</h3>
Fitted lines are often presented with uncertainty bands around
them. There are two types of bands:
<li> Confidence bands - refer to the POPULATION.
<li> Prediction bands - refer to an INDIVIDUAL.
One way to get intervals:
predict(model, interval="confidence")
predict(model, interval="prediction")
In order plot the bands on the same plot as the tted line, use the
following:

<pre><code>
grid <- seq(5,50)
pi <- predict(model, list(x=grid), interval="prediction")
ci <- predict(model, list(x=grid), interval="confidence")
plot(SLR1$x, SLR1$y, xlab="x", ylab="y")
matlines(grid, pi, lty=c(1,2,2), col=c("black", "blue","blue"))
matlines(grid, ci, lty=c(1,3,3), col=c("black", "red","red"))
legend("bottomright", legend=c("Prediction Interval", "Confidence Interval"),
lty=2:3, col=c("blue","red"), bty="n")
</code></pre>


<h5>Prediction Intervals</h5>
In contrast to a confidence interval, which is concerned with estimating a population parameter, a prediction interval is concerned with estimating an individual value and is therefore a type of probability interval. 

The complete standard error for a prediction interval is called the standard error of forecast, and it includes the uncertainty associated with the vertical “scatter” about the regression line plus the uncertainty associated with the position of the regression line value itself.
