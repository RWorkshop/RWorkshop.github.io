\begin{slide}{Review of SLR}
\begin{itemize}
\item Used function lm() to fit model.
\item Determined regression coefficients.
\item Residuals and fitted values.
\item Used summary() to determine inference values for the regression coefficients.
\item Correlation, scatterplots etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


%---------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide}{Data}
\begin{itemize}

\item
The data give scores for the taste of a cheese (Taste) from 30 different formulations which caused variation
in the concentration in the cheese of acetic acid (Acetic), hydrogen sulphide (H2S)
and lactic acid (Lactic).

\item data in MLR.r

\item For SLR, using Acetic as only explanatory variable (for simplicity).
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}




\section{SLR Diagnostics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Once the model has been fitted, we must check the residuals.
\item The residuals should be independent and normally distributed with
mean of 0 .
\item Use a histogram of the residuals
\item Can also use a Q-Q plot. ( i.e. qqnorm())
\item The residuals should must have constant variance.
\item Use a plot of fitted values vs residuals.
\end{itemize}


%---------------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{SLR Diagnostics}
\begin{verbatim}

>model =lm(Taste ~ Acetic)
>par(mfrow=c(2,2))
>       #Histogram
>hist(resid(model))
>       #QQ plot
>qqnorm(resid(model))
>plot(fitted(model), resid(model))
>par(mfrow=c(1,1))	#reset
\end{verbatim}

The residuals seem to be normally distributed, judging by the histogram and QQ plot.
There seems to be consistent variance too in the residual plot, but a possible ``funnell effect" .

\end{slide}

%---------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide} {Multiple regression}
Multiple regression is carried out when there is more than one
explanatory variable.
The multiple linear regression model has the form:\\
$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x1 + \beta_{2}x2 ....+ \beta_{p}Xp + \epsilon$\\
Where the beta values are the regression coefficients and the 'x's are the predictor variables.\\
The number of predictor variables is 'p'.

\end{slide}

%---------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide}{Cheese Data}
\begin{itemize}

\item We wish to model the dependence of the taste score
on the concentrations of those three constituents, using the n = 30 observations.

\item We also wish to assess if one of the constituents has no effect at all.
\item We can build various candidate models and choose the best.

\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%---------------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{MLR}
A number of models were fitted.
\begin{verbatim}

>model1=lm(Taste~ Acetic + H2S)
>model2 =lm(Taste~ Acetic + Lactic)
>model3 =lm(Taste~ Lactic + H2S)
>model4 =lm(Taste~ Acetic + Lactic + H2S)
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}



%---------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide} {Coefficient of determination}
\begin{itemize}
\item One can measure how well the model succeeds in explaining the variation in the
response by the Coefficient of Determination $R^2$, (which is defined by the ratio of the
Sum of squares for the slopes to the Total sum of squares in ANOVA)

\item $R^2 = \frac{p S_{\beta}^2}{(n-1)S_{y}^2}$

\item $R^2$ found using the summary() function also.

\item The higher the value of $R^2$ the better.

\item $R^2$ is usually thought of as the proportion of the variation in the response variable
explained by the regression. \item Often, one would look for $R^2$ over 60\% before thinking
that a model was useful.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%---------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide} {Multiple Regression}
\begin{itemize}
\item $R^2$  is the square of the correlation coefficient between the values of the
response variable and the fitted values from the model.

\item There is also an F-test for the Null Hypothesis that the population analogue of R2 is 0 against
the alternative that it is greater than 0. This is a test of whether there is any point in
fitting the regression at all.
\item A first check is to look at the scatter plots of
the response variable Taste against each of the explanatory variables.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{R squared}
\begin{verbatim}
> summary(model1)$r.squared
[1] 0.5821773
> summary(model2)$r.squared
[1] 0.5202762
> summary(model3)$r.squared
[1] 0.6517024
> summary(model4)$r.squared
[1] 0.6517747
\end{verbatim}
Model 4 has the highest value for $R^2$.
\end{slide}
%---------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide} {Multiple Regression}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the number of explanatory variables is increased, then $R^2$ always decreases.
 So if one wants to choose how many explanatory variables to include in the model,
one cant depend entirely on $R^2$, because that would always suggest putting in every
explanatory variable available.

\item One should look also at Students t values for the estimated
slopes.

\item The Adjusted Coefficient of Determination, which makes
an attempt to correct for the number of explanatory variables used (i.e. penalizes using too many)

\item Some explanatory variables may give the same information as each other. So all are not required.


\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
%---------------------------------------------------

\begin{slide}{Adjusted R squared}
\begin{verbatim}
> summary(model1)$adj.r.squared
[1] 0.5512274
> summary(model2)$adj.r.squared
[1] 0.4847411
> summary(model3)$adj.r.squared
[1] 0.6259025
> summary(model4)$adj.r.squared
[1] 0.6115948
\end{verbatim}
Model 3 has the highest value for Adjusted $R^2$.
