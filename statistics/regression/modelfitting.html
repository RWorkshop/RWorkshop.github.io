\subsection*{Linear regression model}

We can draw a scatterplot to assess the relationship between X and Y.
The commmand we will use is plot.
To fit a linear model,
the relevant r command is lm().
Lets save the output as a data object called Fit1.

Summary()  
is a very useful command when using Linear models.

\subsection{Fitting a Regression Model}
A regression model is fitted using the \texttt{lm()} command.

Consider the response variable $F$ and predictor variable $C$.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
C=c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12) 
F=c(2.1,5.0,9.0,12.6,17.3,21.0,24.7)
Fit1=lm(F~C)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
