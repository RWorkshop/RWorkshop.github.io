\section{Regression}
The basic form of a formula is ``response $\sim$ model".

\subsection{Simple Linear Regression}

\begin{itemize}
\item `x' is the independent (i.e. predictor) variable, whereas `y' is the dependent `response' variable.
\item Necessarily both x and y should be of equal length.
\item
\end{itemize}


\begin{verbatim}
> lm(y~x)

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)            x
     0.2468       1.0437

Simple linear regression is used to describe the relationship
between two variables. For example, you may want to describe the
relationship between age and blood pressure or the relationship
between scores in a midterm exam and scores in the final exam,
etc.

The intercept $\beta_{0}$ describes the point at which the line intersects
the y axis

The slope $\beta_{1}$ describes the change in y
(response/dependent variable) for every unit increase in x
(explanatory/independent variable).

One of the first steps in a regression analysis is to determine if any
kind of relationship exists between the two variables.
A scatterplot is created and can initially be used to get an idea
about the nature of the relationship between the variables, e.g. if
the relationship is linear, curvilinear, or no relationship exists.

Can see from the scatterplot that there is a linear relationship
between x and y. To measure the strength of this relationship,
calculate the correlation coefficient (cor())

Can add the fitted regression line to the scatterplot:

\begin{verbatim}
plot(x,y,main="Scatterplot")
abline(coef(model), lty=2)
abline(model$coef, lty=2)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
summary(model)
Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)
Residuals:

\section{Simple Linear Regression}

\[
y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + e
\]

$b_0$ is the intercept estimate. $b_1$ is the slope estimate.


\section{Analysis of Variance}
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models, and their associated procedures, in which the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation.
