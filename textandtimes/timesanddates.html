<h3>The Chron Package (4.2)</h3>

The chron function converts dates and times to chron objects. The dates and times are provided to the chron function as separate values, so some preprocessing may be necessary to prepare input date/times for the chron function.

The chron package converts dates and times to chron objects.
<pre><code>
library(chron)
dtimes=c(“2002-06-09 12:45:40”)
dtparts=t(as.data.frame(strsplit(dtimes,’ ‘)))
rownames(dtparts=NULL
</code></pre>

Chron values are stored internally as the fractional number of days from January 1 1970. The as.numeric function can be used to access interal values
