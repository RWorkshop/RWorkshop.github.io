<h3>Using R's help commands</h3>
As mentioned earlier, R has an inbuilt help facility. To get more information on any specific named function, for example “boxplot”, the command is: “?boxplot” or “help(boxplot)”

<pre><code>
>?boxplot		  # access help on boxplots
>help(Im)     # access help on "Im"
</code></pre>

A description of the package – as well as some demonstration code – are provided.

Try out the demonstration code.

On most R installations help is available in HTML format by running help.start() which will launch a Web browser that allows the help pages to be browsed with hyperlinks. 
 
<pre><code>
>help.start()
</code></pre>

There is also an “apropos” function. This command returns a list of the names of all objects matching the argument. This is very useful for finding out what commands and functions are available.
Suppose we want to find out a way of performing a correlation analysis. Use “cor” as the argument (short, but not too short).
<pre><code>
> apropos("cor")
[1] ".__C__recordedplot" "cancor"             "cor"               
[4] "cor.test"           "cov2cor"            "Harman23.cor"      
[7] "Harman74.cor"       "recordGraphics"     "recordPlot"    
</code></pre>
