\section{Vectors and Sequences}
\subsection{Vectors}

%The primary data type in R is the vector. Before describing how vectors work in R, it is helpful to distinguish two ideas of vectors in order to set the correct expectations.



A vector in \texttt{R} is a container vector, a statistician's collection of data, not a mathematical vector. The \texttt{R} language is designed around the assumption that a vector is an ordered set of measurements rather than a geometrical position or a physical state. (\texttt{R} supports mathematical vector operations, but they are secondary in the design of the language.) This helps explain, for example, \texttt{R}'s otherwise inexplicable vector recycling feature.

Adding a vector of length 22 and a vector of length 45 in most languages would raise an exception; the language designers would assume the programmer has made an error and the program is now in an undefined state. However, \texttt{R} allows adding two vectors regardless of their relative lengths.

\subsubsection{Recycling}
 The elements of the shorter summand are recycled as often as necessary to create a vector the length of the longer summand. This is not attempting to add physical vectors that are incompatible for addition, but rather a syntactic convenience for manipulating sets of data. (\texttt{R} does issue a warning when adding vectors of different lengths and the length of the longer vector is not an integer multiple of the length of the shorter vector. So, for example, adding vectors of lengths 3 and 7 would cause a warning, but adding vectors of length 3 and 6 would not.)

The \texttt{R}  language has no provision for scalars, nothing like a double in C-family languages. The only way to represent a single number in a variable is to use a vector of length one. And while it is possible to iterate through vectors as one might do in a for loop in C, it is usually clearer and more efficient in \texttt{R} to operate on vectors as a whole.

\subsection{Creating Vectors}
Vectors are created using the c function. For example, \texttt{p <- c(2,3,5,7)} sets p to the vector containing the first four prime numbers.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
p <- c(2,3,5,7)
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
%Vectors in R are indexed starting with 1 and matrices in are stored in column-major order. In both of these ways R resembles FORTRAN.

\begin{itemize}
\item Elements of a vector can be accessed using the square bracket operators []. So in the above example, \texttt{p[3]} is 5.

\item Vectors automatically expand when assigning to an index past the end of the vector.

\item Negative indices are legal, but they have a very different meaning than in some other languages. If x is an array in Python or Perl, x[-n] returns the nth element from the end of the vector. In \texttt{R}, x[-n] returns a copy of x with the nth element removed.
\end{itemize}

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
p <- c(2,3,5,7)
p[2]
p[-2]
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}

\begin{verbatim}
> p <- c(2,3,5,7)
> p
[1] 2 3 5 7
> p[2]
[1] 3
> p[-2]
[1] 2 5 7
\end{verbatim}

\section{Vectors}
 Vectors are the simplest type of object in R. There are 3 main types of vectors:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Numeric vectors
\item Character vectors
\item Logical vectors
\end{itemize}
To set up a numeric vector x consisting of 7 numbers; {10, 5, 3, 6, 21,11,41}, we use the \texttt{c()} command to “concatenate” them –i.e create a vector of individual values.
To print the contents of x, simply type “x”

\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
x <- c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21,11,41) 
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
> x <- c(10, 5, 3, 6, 21,11,41) 
> x 
[1] 10 5 3 6 21 11 41
\end{verbatim}

The [1] in front of the result is the index of the first element in the vector x. (The single value variables from earlier on are simply vectors containing one element).
To access a particular element of a vector, and the position of the element enclosed in square brackets.

\subsection{Useful Commands For Vectors}

\begin{verbatim}
Newvec = c(13,16,36,55,23,11)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{sort(Newvec)}  -  sort data set in ascending order
\item \texttt{rev(Newvec) } -  reverse the data set order
\item \texttt{rep(Newvec,n)}  -  replicate the data set $n$ times
\item \texttt{rep(Newvec,each=n)} - replicate each element of the data set $n-$times
\item \texttt{diff(Newvec)} - sequential difference of each element
\item \texttt{order(Newvec)}
\item \texttt{rank(Newvec)}
\end{itemize}


\begin{verbatim}
> Newvec = c(13,16,36,55,23,11)
>
> sort(Newvec)
[1] 11 13 16 23 36 55
> rev(Newvec)
[1] 11 23 55 36 16 13
>
> rep(Newvec,2)
 [1] 13 16 36 55 23 11 13 16 36 55 23 11
> rep(Newvec,3)
 [1] 13 16 36 55 23 11 13 16 36 55 23 11 13 16 36 55 23 11
>
> rep(Newvec,each=3)
 [1] 13 13 13 16 16 16 36 36 36 55 55 55 23 23 23 11 11 11
> diff(Newvec)
[1]   3  20  19 -32 -12
> order(Newvec)
[1] 6 1 2 5 3 4
>
> rank(Newvec)
[1] 2 3 5 6 4 1
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Sequences}
\subsubsection{Using the colon operator}
A `count-up' or a `count-down' sequence of integers will be determined automatically. This operator is very useful and we will make use of it frequently.
\begin{framed}
\begin{verbatim}
1:20
20:1
10:20
\end{verbatim}
\end{framed}
\subsubsection{Using the \texttt{seq()} operator}
Firstly we will mimic the sequences that we have created using the colon operator.
\begin{verbatim}
seq(1,20)
seq(20,1)
\end{verbatim}
