<h5>While Loops in <code>R</code></h5>
The <code>while</code> operator allows a set of commands to be repeated until a specific logical condition is met.

Importantly the logical condition you specify as an argument is the opposite of what you are trying to do.
<h6>Example: The Clever Lecturer</h6>

<pre><code>while( logical condition is meet)</code></pre>
